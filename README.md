## My process


### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/pages/getting-started/) - For styles
- [Tabler Icons](https://tabler-icons-react.vercel.app/) - For Icons

### What I learned

I learnt about Backtracking. Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally. Which is the perfect approch to make a sudoku solver.
